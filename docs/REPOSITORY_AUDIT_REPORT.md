### 4.2 Duplicate/Unnecessary Files Found

| File | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| `libobs/util/memory-pool-fixed.h` | Identical to `memory-pool.h` | **Removed**, updated test include |
| `test/test-*.cpp` (4 files) | Not in CMake build system | Standalone tests, kept as-is |
| Decklink SDK versioned headers | Multiple versions | Upstream pattern, no action needed |

### 4.3 File Structure Assessment
- ✅ Fork-specific code is well-organized in `libobs/util/`
- ✅ Benchmarks have dedicated `benchmark/` directory
- ✅ Tests are split between standalone (.cpp) and CMocka (.c)
- ✅ Documentation in `docs/` directory
- ⚠️ Standalone test files (test-*.cpp) are not integrated into CMake build
